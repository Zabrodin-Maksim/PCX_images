<b>Usage</b><br>
PCX is used in Microsoft Windows and
      Windows-based products but has found wide acceptance mainly in
      the MS-DOS world. It is mainly an exchange
      and storage format.
<p>
<b>Comments</b><br>
A partially documented format in wide use, which is quick and
      easy to read and decompress. It lacks, however, a superior
      compression scheme, making it unsuitable for the storage of
      deep-pixel images.

<P>

PCX is one of the most widely used storage
formats. It originated with ZSoft's MS-DOS-based
PC Paintbrush, and because of this,
PCX is sometimes referred to as the
PC Paintbrush format. ZSoft entered into an
OEM arrangement with Microsoft, which allowed
Microsoft to bundle PC Paintbrush with various
products, including a version called Microsoft Paintbrush for Windows;
this product was distributed with every copy of Microsoft Windows
sold. This distribution established the importance of
PCX, not only on Intel-based
MS-DOS platforms, but industry-wide.

<P>
PCX has been used by manufacturers of
computer-based FAX boards and also as a general
format for the storage of clip art targeted at the desktop publishing
aftermarket.

<P>
The original PCX format (starting with v2.5
of PC Paintbrush) stored graphics and images with
no more than 16 colors, due to the limitations of Enhanced Graphics
Adapter (EGA)
display technology produced by IBM. When
IBM introduced the Virtual Graphics Array
(VGA) display adapter,
the PCX format was revised to store graphics and
images with up to 256 colors.

<P>
The latest revision of the PCX format now includes
the ability to store 24-bit color images. This allows the
PCX format to be used for the storage of images
created by the most advanced graphics, imaging, and video technology
available today.

<P>
PCX is hardware-dependent in the sense that it was
originally designed to accommodate a specific type of display
hardware. Data may be stored either plane- or pixel-oriented, to
accommodate the hardware design of the plane-oriented
IBM EGA or the pixel-oriented
IBM VGA display adapters.

<P>
Image data is encoded using an RLE variant, which
is simple and somewhat quick in its operation, if not terribly
efficient in actually reducing the size of the data. As with other
RLE schemes, how much the PCX
compression scheme reduces the size of a given image is difficult to
say, because the reduction factor is dependent largely upon the
content of the image (how "busy" the image is) and how many colors are
actually used. Generally, an image incorporating 16 or fewer colors
will be reduced by 40 to 70 percent from the original data, whereas a
64- to 256-color image from a scanner or video source may be reduced
by only 10 to 30 percent. It is possible for an image to be so complex
that the PCX compression scheme actually causes the
data to increase in size after compression. (For further discussion of
these and other topics, please see <A HREF="../book/ch09_01.htm">Chapter 9, <i>Data Compression</i></A>.)

<h2><A NAME="PCX-DMYID.2">File Organization</A></h2>

<P>
PCX files are organized into three major sections:
the header, the image data, and the color palette. The color palette
normally contains entries for 256 colors and is associated with the
VGA display adapter. This VGA
color palette is only found in later versions of the
PCX image file format.

<h2><A NAME="PCX-DMYID.3">File Details</A></h2>

<P>
This section describes the major sections of PCX
files and methods of reading, compressing, encoding, and decoding
these files.

<h3><A NAME="PCX-DMYID.3.1">Header</A></h3>

<P>
The first 128 bytes of every PCX file is the
header, which has the following format:
<pre>
typedef struct _PcxHeader
{
  BYTE  Identifier;        /* PCX Id Number (Always 0x0A) */
  BYTE  Version;           /* Version Number */
  BYTE  Encoding;          /* Encoding Format */
  BYTE  BitsPerPixel;      /* Bits per Pixel */
  WORD  XStart;            /* Left of image */
  WORD  YStart;            /* Top of Image */
  WORD  XEnd;              /* Right of Image
  WORD  YEnd;              /* Bottom of image */
  WORD  HorzRes;           /* Horizontal Resolution */
  WORD  VertRes;           /* Vertical Resolution */
  BYTE  Palette[48];       /* 16-Color EGA Palette */
  BYTE  Reserved1;         /* Reserved (Always 0) */
  BYTE  NumBitPlanes;      /* Number of Bit Planes */
  WORD  BytesPerLine;      /* Bytes per Scan-line */
  WORD  PaletteType;       /* Palette Type */
  WORD  HorzScreenSize;    /* Horizontal Screen Size */
  WORD  VertScreenSize;    /* Vertical Screen Size */
  BYTE  Reserved2[54];     /* Reserved (Always 0) */
} PCXHEAD;
</pre>
<P>
Identifier is an identification value defined by the
PCX specification as always being 10h. This value
has no real meaning other than to indicate that the file is a ZSoft
PCX file. PCX readers should
always check that this byte contains the proper value, even though the
file may have the extension PCX. However, it is
possible that a non-PCX format file might also
begin with the value 10h, so the remainder of the header information
should be read, and the information fields be checked for the proper
values before trying to decode any image data in the file. In other
words, don't just jump to byte offset 128 and start decoding what you
think is encoded image data.

<P>
Version contains the version of Paintbrush that created the
PCX file. ZSoft has released updated revisions of
the PCX format to keep up with the increasing
functionality of its PC Paintbrush program and the
burgeoning display adapter technology available for the
PC. Each PCX file version has
separate requirements for handling and displaying its image. Prior to
v2.5 of PC Paintbrush, the
PCX image file format was considered proprietary
information by ZSoft Corporation.

<P>
Encoding indicates the type of encoding used on the image data. The
only encoding algorithm currently supported by the
PCX specification is a simple byte-wise run-length
encoding (RLE) scheme indicated by a value of 1 in
this byte. It would seem to follow that if a PCX
file held unencoded image data this value would be
0. PCX files, however, always contain encoded image
data, and currently the only valid value for the encoding field is 1.

<P>
BitsPerPixel is the number of bits per pixel per plane in the image
data. The possible values are 1, 2, 4, and 8 for 2-, 4-, 16-, and
256-color images. The planar data in a scan line is often padded with
extra data to align the scan line on an even byte boundary to prevent
aliasing (the "jaggies"). PCX paint and conversion
programs use this value to find where in a scan line pixel data stops
and extra padding begins.

<P>
XStart, YStart, XEnd, and YEnd store the size of the image in
pixels. These four values are the rectangular dimensions of the
visible part of the PCX image (sometimes called the
<i>picture dimension window</i>) and its position
relative to the physical display screen. Using these dimensions, the
largest PCX image that can be stored is
65,535x65,535 pixels in size. The dimensions are the location of
the upper-left and lower-right corners of the PCX
image on the display screen. The upper-left corner of the screen is
considered to be at location 0,0, and any PCX image
with an XStart and YStart of 0 will start displaying at this
location. If the XStart and YStart are values greater than zero, then
a display program should start displaying the PCX
image starting at those pixel coordinates. However, this is a feature
rarely supported by PCX display programs.

<P>
Any PCX image may contain extra bytes of padding at
the end of each scan line or extra scan lines added to the bottom of
the image. To prevent this extra data from becoming visible, only the
image data within the picture dimension window coordinates is
displayed.

<P>
HorzRes and VertRes are the horizontal and vertical size of the stored
image in pixels per line or dots per inch
(DPI). Scanned images have the
DPI value of the device that created them. Typical
DPI values for a scanned image may be 100x100
DPI or 300x300 DPI. An
image produced by a FAX card can have a resolution
of 100x200 DPI or 200x200
DPI. Images created by paint or screen dump
programs will have pixel resolution values that reflect the resolution
of the display mode under which they were created. For example, a
typical VGA paint program saves images with a
horizontal resolution of 320 pixels and a vertical resolution of 200
pixels. However, these values are not used when decoding image data.

<P>
Palette is a 48-byte array of 8-bit values that make up a 16-color
EGA color palette. The earliest version of
PC Paintbrush was not able to use a modifiable
EGA palette and, therefore, used only the standard
palette of the EGA.  Subsequent versions have
allowed the use of a modifiable palette enabling a
PCX image file writer to choose which 16 (or fewer)
of the 64 colors available to the EGA to use.

<P>
Reserved1 is not currently used and should have a value of 00h. Older
versions of PCX used this field for file
identification or to hold the mode value of the display screen on
which the PCX image was created. Several paint and
graphics display programs will, in fact, claim that a
PCX file is invalid if this field is not set to
00h.

<P>
NumBitPlanes is the number of color planes that contains the image
data. The number of planes is usually 1, 3, or 4 and is used in
conjunction with the BitsPerPixel value to determine the proper video
mode in which to display the image. PCX video
display modes are shown as follows:

NumBitPlanes is also used to determine the maximum number of colors a
PCX image may have. The number of bits per pixel
per plane is multiplied by the number of color planes and shifted to
the left by one:
<pre>
MaxNumberOfColors = (1L &lt;&lt; (BitsPerPixel * NumBitPlanes));
</pre>
<P>
BytesPerLine is a 16-bit value indicating the size in bytes of a color
plane in an unencoded scan line. This value may be multiplied by the
NumBitPlanes value to find the total length of an unencoded scan line
in bytes:
<pre>
ScanLineLength = (BytesPerLine * NumBitPlanes);
</pre>
<P>
PaletteType contains an indicator of information held in the color
palette. A value of 1 indicates color or monochrome information, while
a 2 indicates gray-scale information. This value is actually an
indicator of whether the image should be displayed in color or
gray-scale. (Only VGA is capable of displaying true
gray-scale images.) PC Paintbrush and most other
programs that use PCX files ignore this value.

<P>
HorzScreenSize and VertScreenSize were added to the
PCX format starting with PC
Paintbrush 4.0 and 4.0 Plus. These horizontal and vertical screen-size
values represent the resolution of the screen on which the image was
created. This allows graphics display programs to adjust their video
mode to allow for proper display of the PCX
image. Because these fields were added after the release of
PC Paintbrush 3.0, there is no way to know if these
fields contain valid information or are part of the Reserved2
field. Therefore, always check these values to be sure they are
reasonable before you use them.

<P>
Reserved2 is the last field in the header and is a run of bytes with
the value 00h.  This filler field is used to pad the header out to a
full 128 bytes and to save room for additional fields that might be
added to the header in future revisions of the PCX
format. The size of this field will be either 54 or 58 bytes,
depending on whether or not the header contains the HorizScreenSize
and VertScreenSize fields.

<h3><A NAME="PCX-DMYID.3.2">Palette</A></h3>

<P>
The color palette information within a PCX file
varies depending upon the version of the PCX file.

<h4><A NAME="PCX-DMYID.3.2.1">16-color EGA palette</A></h4>

<P>
The first version of the PCX format did not support
a modifiable color palette, so the values of the standard
EGA color palette were always used. Later versions
of PC Paintbrush could work with or without a
modifiable palette, so two more versions of the PCX
format appeared, one with palette information (modifiable palette) and
one without palette information (standard EGA
palette).

<P>
The EGA palette is a 48-byte array of 16
RGB triples. Each color triple contains a red,
green, and blue value, each with a range of 0 to 255. The palette will
contain entries for 2, 4, 8, or 16 color triples with any remaining
entries being set to 00h. No interpretation is necessary for display
adapters using this format of color values. The
EGA, however, has only four possible values for
each RGB color (0 through 3), so each
RGB value is shifted to the right by six to obtain
the proper value. To extract the proper values to load into the
EGA palette registers, the following code is used:
<pre>
EgaColor0Red   = EgaPalette[0] &gt;&gt; 6;
EgaColor0Green = EgaPalette[1] &gt;&gt; 6;
EgaColor0Blue  = EgaPalette[2] &gt;&gt; 6;
EgaColor1Red   = EgaPalette[3] &gt;&gt; 6;
EgaColor1Green = EgaPalette[4] &gt;&gt; 6;
EgaColor1Blue  = EgaPalette[5] &gt;&gt; 6;
 <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>
</pre>
<h4><A NAME="PCX-DMYID.3.2.2">4-color CGA palette</A></h4>

<P>
The EGA color palette is also used for displaying
CGA images. Two- or four-color images may be
displayed on the CGA using one of eight possible
color palettes, each consisting of three foreground colors and one
background color.

<P>
The most significant four bits of the first byte of the
EGA color palette contains the background color and
is in the range of 0 to 15.

<P>
The most significant three bits of the fourth byte of the color
palette contains the foreground color. The three bits of the
foreground color correspond to the Color Burst Enable, Palette, and
Intensity settings of the CGA, as shown below.

</pre>
<h4><A NAME="PCX-DMYID.3.2.3">256-color VGA palette</A></h4>

<P>
When PCX was conceived, the EGA
was the premium display adapter available from IBM
for the PC. The EGA could
display only 16 colors from a palette of 64, so PCX
was originally designed with a color palette large enough to hold only
16 colors.

<P>
The 16-color EGA technology of 1984, however, gave
way to the 256-color VGA technology of
1987. PCX now fell short of VGA
standard images that could contain up to 256 colors from a palette of
262,144, and a new color palette needed to be added to the
PCX file format for VGA
images. Because there was not enough room in the header for it, the
designers of the PCX format appended it to the end
of the PCX file itself.

<P>
This unconventional, if not inconvenient, location for the
VGA palette presents a problem; because the size of
the image data varies, the location of the VGA
palette is different for every file. The position of the palette must
be determined by its offset from the end of the file rather than from
the beginning.

<P>
To see if a VGA palette is attached to a file, seek
backwards 769 bytes from the end of the file. If the byte at this
location is set to value C0h, then the 768 bytes following this value
constitute a VGA color palette. The
PCX specification states that if the version number
in the header (byte 1) is 5 (v3.0), then there might be a
VGA color palette attached.

<P>
Normally, a PCX file must have a
VGA color palette
 attached only if there are more than 16
colors in the image; otherwise the EGA palette can
be used.  However, many graphics programs create v3.0
PCX image files without a VGA
color palette, while other programs always attach a
VGA color palette, even for 2-color images. To
confuse things even more, 24-bit PCX images are
always marked as v3.0, yet never have an attached color
palette.

<P>
A v3.0 PCX image might not have a color
palette; the value 768 bytes from the end of the file might be 0Ch by
coincidence. In this rare case, a PCX reader would
interpret the last 768 bytes of the encoded image data as a
VGA palette, so a truly bizarre displayed image
would result. One solution to this problem would be to first read all
the image data and note whether the file pointer stopped 769 bytes
from the end of the file. If so, then a
VGA color palette is present. Another method would be
to check the three bytes following the 0Ch value. This is the first
color of the color palette and is normally black, so the three bytes
following the suspect VGA palette indicator value
should all be zero.

<P>
When a VGA palette is present in the file, its
information is always used to display the image data, rather than
using any information that may be present in the
EGA color palette. If the colors in an image do not
display correctly, it may be necessary to disable the color palette so
the display hardware may use its native color palette. Disabling the
color palette is accomplished by changing the version number in the
header (byte 1) from 5 to 3. The display software should recognize
that this version of the format has no color palette and, therefore,
should use its own default palette.

<P>
The VGA palette itself is an array of 768 bytes
(256x3) containing the red, green, and blue values for each of
the 256 possible colors in a VGA
PCX image.  Color values are organized into
triples, as in the EGA palette. Bytes 0, 1, and 2
are the red, green, and blue values for the color 0; bytes 3, 4, and 5
are the red, green, and blues values for color 1; and so on. Each
RGB value is in the range of 0 to 255.

<P>
 In fact, the VGA palette is simply a
much longer version of the EGA palette.
VGA display devices, however, require that palette
color values be in the range of 0 to 63, so all RGB
values should be divided by four (shifted to the right
twice). VGA images may have 2-, 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-,
64-, 128-, or 256-color entries in the palette.

<h3><A NAME="PCX-DMYID.3.3">Reading the PCX Header</A></h3>

<P>
The PCX specification does not specifically state
that the PCX image file format must use the least
significant byte-ordering scheme used on Intel
80<i>x</i> 86 processors, but we may safely
assume that this is so because the PCX format was
developed for use on Intel-based machines. If code that reads
PCX-format files will only be executed on Intel
machines, it is possible, although not portable, to use the
fread() function to read the header on a
little-endian machine:
<pre>
PCXHEADER pcx;
if(fread(&amp;pcx, sizeof(char), sizeof(PCXHEADER), fp) !=
        sizeof(PCXHEADER))
    fputs("Error reading PCX header.", stderr);
</pre>
<h3><A NAME="PCX-DMYID.3.4">Compressing PCX Data</A></h3>

<P>
The data-encoding algorithm used in PCX files is a
simple 1-byte/2-byte run-length encoding scheme. While this type of
encoding is not the most effective in terms of reducing data size, it
is very quick in its operation and quite easy to implement.

<P>
An image normally contains many series of pixel runs,
that is, two or more contiguous pixels of the same value. Using the
run-length data compression scheme, a run of pixels several bytes in
length may be converted to a run code only two bytes in length.

<P>
The encoded data is read one byte at a time. If the two most
significant bits (MSB) of the first byte read are
set to 1, then this byte is the first byte of a 2-byte run code. The
first byte in a 2-byte run code always contains the run count in its
lower six bits, which is the length of the pixel run.  Therefore, a
pixel run may be 1 to 63 pixels in length.

<P>
Using the two most significant bits to indicate a 2-byte code rather
than just one, MSB is a holdover from the early
CGA days of Paintbrush. Use of only one
MSB resulted in poor compression for
CGA data, so two were used instead.

<P>
The second byte of a 2-byte run code is the value of the pixel run
itself. This value may be in the range 0 to 255 and is written to the
output a number of times equal to the run count.

<P>
If a run-count byte is read and the two MSBs are
both 0, then this byte is a run-value byte, and the run count is
considered to be 1. This 1-byte run code is used to prevent a 1-pixel
run from encoding into a 2-byte run code.

<P>
The PCX RLE encoding scheme is
not perfect, however. A 1-byte run code can contain a run value only
in the range 0 to 63. If the pixel run value is in the range 64 to
255, a 2-byte run code must be used instead. If an image contains many
single pixel runs of color values greater than 63, an increase of
image data size can occur after PCX encoding. Such
an increase in data size typically occurs only in very noisy or grainy
images.

<h3><A NAME="PCX-DMYID.3.5">Decoding a PCX Format File</A></h3>

<P>
To decode a file in PCX format, you must read the
header of the file and calculate the following data:
<p><ul>

<li>Width of image in pixels

<P>

<li>Length of image in scan lines

<P>

<li>Number of bytes needed to hold a decoded scan
line

<P>

<li>Number of padding bytes at the end of each scan
line

<P>
</ul><p>
<P>
Calculate the image width and height from the image dimension values
as follows:
<pre>
ImageWidth  = XEnd - XStart + 1; /* Width of image in pixels */
ImageHeight = YEnd - YStart + 1; /* Length of image in scan lines */
</pre>
<P>
Calculating the number of bytes required to hold a decoded scan line
is necessary if the decoded image data is to be stored in a buffer. It
is also necessary to determine if the image data has been encoded
across scan lines. The number of color planes multiplied by the number
of bytes per line per plane yields this value:
<pre>
ScanLineLength = NumBitPlanes * BytesPerLine;
</pre>
<P>
The length of padding at the end of a scan line may be determined by
calculating the number of pixels in an unencoded scan line and
comparing this value with the pixel width of the displayed image:
<pre>
LinePaddingSize = ((BytesPerLine * NumBitPlanes) *
                  (8 / BitsPerPixel)) - ((XEnd - XStart) + 1);
</pre>
<P>
The decoding steps are the following:
<p><ol>

<li>Read a byte.

<P>

<li>If the two MSBs are set to 1, then
mask off the run count.

<P>

<li>Read next byte.

<P>

<li>Write the byte a number of times equal to the run
count.

<P>

<li>Else, if the two MSBs are set to 0,
then mask off the run value.

<P>

<li>Write the byte once.

<P>

<li>Repeat steps 1 through 6 until the buffer is
full.

<P>
</ol><p>
<P>
The code used to decode a scan line of information is as shown as follows:
<pre>
/*
** Decode a PCX scan line.
**
** In this example the size of Buffer[] and the value of BufferSize
** is equal to the scan line length. Data is read from the FILE
** stream fpIn and written to Buffer[].
*/
do
{
  byte = GetByte(fpIn);                  /* Get next byte */
  if ((byte &amp; 0xC0) == 0xC0)             /* 2-byte code */
    runcount = byte &amp; 0x3F;              /* Get run count */
    runvalue = GetByte(fpIn);            /* Get pixel value */
    }
  else                                   /* 1-byte code */
    {
    runcount = 1;                        /* Run count is one */
    runvalue = byte;                     /* Pixel value */
    }
  /* Write the pixel run to the buffer */
  for (total += runcount;                /* Update total */
    runcount &amp;&amp; index &lt; BufferSize;      /* Don't read past buffer */
  runcount--, index++)                   /* Update counters */
  Buffer[index] = runvalue;              /* Assign value to buffer */
  } while (index &lt; BufferSize);          /* Read to end of buffer */
</pre>
<P>
The PCX specification states that a decoding break
should occur at the end of each scan line. This means that when a run
of data is being encoded, and the end of the scan line is reached, the
run should stop and not continue across to the next scan line, if it
is possible to stop it.

<P>
Decoding can be complicated by PCX files that have
been encoded ignoring this rule. Encoding across scan lines gains a
few extra bytes of compression, but the process of decoding a single
scan line is made much more difficult.

<h3><A NAME="PCX-DMYID.3.6">Encoding PCX Image Data</A></h3>

<P>
The scheme for encoding a scan line is fairly straightforward with
only a few exceptions. Raw data is read one byte at a time. The only
information needed is the number of bytes in a scan line. The
following is the procedure for encoding image data using the
PCX compression algorithm:

<p><ol>

<li>Read a byte of pixel data, and store the
value.

<P>

<li>Set counter to 1.

<P>

<li>Read the next byte, and check if it is the same as the
stored value.

<P>

<li>If it is the same, increment the counter.

<P>

<li>If it is not the same and the count is greater than
one, or the count is 63, or if the end of the scan line has been
reached, then mask on the two MSBs, and output the
count value.

<P>

<li>Output the data value.

<P>

<li>Repeat steps 1 though 6 until all scan lines have been
read.

<P>
</ol><p>
<h3><A NAME="PCX-DMYID.3.7">PCX Image Data Format</A></h3>

<P>
Once a scan line has been decoded, the format of the data it contains
depends upon the BitsPerPixel and the NumBitPlanes values found in the
header. Knowing the data format of a scan line is necessary so you can
parse the pixel data from a scan line for display of the image or
conversion of the image file from one format to another. All scan
lines in a PCX file always have the same format.

<P>
Scan-line pixel data is stored in one of two ways--either
pixel-oriented or plane-oriented. Pixel-oriented data is stored with
all the pixel data (either real data or indexes into a color palette)
in a contiguous line. Plane-oriented data unrolls the pixel data into
its red, green, and blue components and groups them by color across
the scan line.

<P>
Single-plane data is stored pixel by pixel in one long plane that runs
the length of the scan line. The data in the scan line is not the
actual image data itself but is instead a series of index values into
either the EGA or VGA color
palettes. The exception for single-plane data is the 1-bit monochrome
image, where each bit in a scan line maps directly as a pixel value.

<P>
How much of the scan-line data a single pixel occupies is determined
from the BitsPerPixel value. For example, with one bit per pixel,
every byte of scan-line data contains eight pixel values. With eight
bits per pixel, every byte of scan-line data contains one pixel
value. Monochrome, CGA, and 256-color
VGA images usually contain only a single plane per
scan line.

<P>
Scan lines with three planes are uncommon, but they do exist. 24-bit
PCX images are stored using three bytes per pixel
spread over three planes. The 24-bit data values are the actual color
values for the image, and no color palette is used. Paintbrush for
Windows 2.0 uses a 3-plane/1-bit data format to store 8-color images,
where each pixel value is an index into the EGA
color palette.

<P>
Images with four planes are usually 16-color EGA
images. In addition to the red, green, and blue planes, there is a
fourth intensity color plane that is specific to the
EGA display card. Scan-line data in 4-plane images
contains index values into the EGA palette.

<h3><A NAME="PCX-DMYID.3.8">Related File Formats</A></h3>

<P>
Several other formats are direct spinoffs of the
PCX file format. And in most cases they are just
specialized versions of PCX.

<h4><A NAME="PCX-DMYID.3.8.1">PCC image file format</A></h4>

<P>
Earlier versions of PC Paintbrush had the
capability of clipping and copying an area of a PCX
image and saving it to a file using the Copy To... command. The
resulting file was saved as a PCX format file with
the extension .PCC,
possibly to indicate that the image the file contained was a portion
of another image.  The current version of PC
Paintbrush does not use the .PCC extension and uses the .PCX extension
instead.

<h4><A NAME="PCX-DMYID.3.8.2">DCX image
file format</A></h4>

<P>
The PCX file format is capable of storing only a
single image per file.  Applications that require two or more
PCX image files to be identified as belonging to
the same group often use a naming convention that will identify a
collection of PCX files as being related to one
another.

<P>
One such application is FAX software, where each
facsimile page is stored as an individual image in a separate
file. PCX became a popular format for
PC-based FAX software, because
facsimile pages saved in this format could be viewed using many
popular paint and image display programs that supported
PCX. However, storing each FAX
page as a separate file can become quite cumbersome and also
confusing, if each image has a cryptic filename.

<P>
In an effort to store PCX files in a manner more
appropriate to facsimile applications, the DCX file
format was created. The DCX format stores up to
1023 PCX images within a single
DCX file. Each image in the DCX
file is a complete PCX image file, including header
and palette information. In applications, DCX files
may contain all of the pages of a facsimile transmission, a series of images
of the same subject, or all of the illustrations within a
document. The DCX header follows:
<pre>
typedef struct _DcxHeader
{
  DWORD Id;                      /* DCX Id number */
  DWORD PageTable[1024];         /* Image offsets */
} DCXHEAD;
</pre>
<P>
Id is a 4-byte word used to identify the file. The value of this word
is 3ADE68B1h (987,654,321 decimal).

<P>
PageTable is a table of 1024 4-byte word values. The values in this
table are the offsets of each PCX image contained
within the DCX file. The offset of each
PCX image is measured from the beginning of the
file (byte 0). The last entry of the page list is the terminator value
and is always set to zero.

<P>
Typically, a DCX file contains an entire 4096-byte
page list (1023 4-byte offset values followed by a 4-byte terminator
value), even if most of the values in the list are zero. Some
DCX file writers may try to save space by writing
only the values of the offsets, followed by a 0 terminating word, but
not the remaining part of the list. It is, therefore, important never
to expect the page list to be a full 4096 bytes in
length. DCX file readers should always read one
value at a time and stop when a word value of zero is read. If the
first offset value in the page list is 1004h (4100 decimal), then an
entire 4096-byte page list is contained within the
DCX file.

<P>
The DCX format is quite convenient and very easy to
use; however, this format suffers from one major drawback. When a
series of PCX files is concatenated into a
DCX file, all the information within the
PCX files is preserved, but the actual names of the
PCX files are lost. No provision in the
DCX format (or in the PCX format
for that matter) exists for storing the MS-DOS
filename of the PCX image files. Therefore, if the
original PCX filenames are important to your
application, you will have to devise some sort of name list that is
maintained outside of the DCX file. Future
revisions of the DCX format might correct this
oversight (perhaps by appending a name list onto the end of the
DCX file itself).
